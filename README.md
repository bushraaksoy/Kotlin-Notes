# Kotlin-Notes

This repository is dedicated to learning the kotlin programming language. So why learn kotlin?

Kotlin, a programming language, has seen a significant surge in popularity among developers over the past four years, particularly after Google’s #IO17 announcement endorsing it as an official language for Android applications. So, what sets this language apart?

Kotlin is a language designed for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it compatible wherever Java is currently utilized (which is virtually everywhere). This encompasses server, client, web, and Android development. JetBrains, the developer of Kotlin, is actively working to extend Kotlin’s reach to embedded systems and iOS, potentially positioning it as a universal language for all application domains.

The appeal of Kotlin among developers lies in its neat language design and robust features. Rather than introducing new concepts, its explicit aim is to amalgamate features of programming languages that have proven advantageous for large-scale projects.

While Kotlin can be employed wherever Java is used (and soon in more areas), its primary use at present is for Android app development, propelled by Google’s official backing. Several companies, including Google, Trello/Atlassian, Pinterest, Kickstarter, and Uber, are leveraging Kotlin to maintain a competitive edge.

### Some of the key benefits of kotlin:

- Kotlin allows writing less code
-  It solves many of the developer challenges
-  Easy to adopt
-  Kotlin is fully compatible with Java
-  Kotlin suits for the multi-platform development
